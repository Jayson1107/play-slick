This is a sample application using Slick and Play as referenced in the "Slick vs. ORM" Talk at Scala Days 2013.
The app suggests an architecture for Slick applications and shows various sample queries and re-usable query abstractions.
The Slick related files can be found in samples/computer-database/app/models/ and samples/computer-database/app/controller/. 
Use Play 2.1 to try it. In branch scaladays2013, folder samples/computer-database/ type play, then type run, access the app via your browser http://localhost:9000/ .
The GUI is very limited. The interesting part is the Scala code using Slick.
